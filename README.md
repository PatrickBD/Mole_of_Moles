# Mole_of_Moles
A game made for the 72 hour xkcd Game Jam based on the "What If?" article of the same name

This game was made in 72 hours for the xkcd Game Jam in November of 2017. For those who don’t know, the theme was to make a game based off of one of the xkcd webcomics or “What If?” articles. As you might imagine, I chose for my project the “What if?” article “A Mole of Moles”. It’s a short witty piece on what a mole(the unit of measurement) of moles(the small furry critter) might look like.

A Mole of Moles is an idle/clicker game with level mechanics. It can be played either actively or passively in the background (however, like any JS game, it will slow down if not an active tab). Buy upgrades and click on the Mole Hole to produce moles. Click on the Thresh-mole-d button when you have enough moles to level up and raise your Mega Mole-tiplier! Try to get to 6.02 x 10^23 moles! It’s exponential-tastic!

I made this game solo within 72 hours for the xkcd game jam using no game making software or templates. Just me and atom, html, and JavaScript. I made all the assets art and such, except the music which is from DL Sounds.  The game is otherwise ~100% complete and playthrough-able.
